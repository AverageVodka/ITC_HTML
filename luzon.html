            <li>
              Finely chop the grilled chicken liver. (You may also use a food
              processor.) In a large bowl, combine the finely chopped grilled
              pork parts and chicken liver.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the onions, chilli, and calamansi juice. Add more calamansi
              juice if you want it more sour. (Note: Sisig should be sour.
              Others use vinegar as their souring agent, I prefer calamansi as
              it adds fragrance to the dish. Vinegar is too acidic, in my
              opinion.)

            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>

          <h1>Kare Kare</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            Kare-Kare is a classic Filipino stew known for its rich and creamy
            peanut-based sauce. Traditionally made with oxtail, beef tripe, or
            pork hock, it’s simmered with vegetables like banana blossoms,
            eggplant, and string beans. Often served with a side of bagoong
            (fermented shrimp paste) for added saltiness, Kare-Kare is a beloved
            dish at Filipino celebrations and family gatherings, offering a
            perfect blend of savory, nutty, and hearty flavors.

            <li>1 whole garlic, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>3 shallots, peeled and sliced</li>
            <li>
              2.2 lbs (1 kilo) beef oxtail or chuck roast cut into large chunks
              (use the latter if you prefer to use just plain beef meat)
            </li>
            <li>1 pound (1/2 kilo) tripe</li>
            <li>
              2 tablespoons fish sauce, or to taste (see recipe instructions for

            <li>freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>

              2 pieces banana blossoms (or flowers), use only the white part (if

            </li>
            <li>
              1 cup Peanut butter, or more as needed (adjust according to taste)
            </li>
            <li>
              2 tablespoons Achiote or Annatto seeds, immersed in 1 cup boiling
              water to extract color, use just enough liquid to achieve mustard
              or deep yellow color for the sauce
            </li>

        <section class="recipe-steps">
          <ol>
            <h1>Procedure:</h1>
            <br />
            <li>
              Bring a pot of water to boil and blanch the oxtail and beef chunks
              plus the tripe until they change color and the scum rises to the
              top roughly 5 minutes. Remove the beef parts, rinse quickly in
              cold water then set aside to drain. This is done to remove
              impurities from the meat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat oil on medium heat in a deep pan. Saute the garlic and
              shallots until aromatic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the meat and tripe. Stir then cover. Allow the meat to sweat
              or render its fat for about 5-10 minutes. Check the meat halfway
              through. Pour enough boiling water to cover the meat. Add the fish
              sauce and freshly ground pepper to season the beef and broth. You
              can also add 2 Knorr beef cubes or beef bouillon to the water for
              extra flavor (especially if you don’t have fish sauce). Cook until
              beef is tender about 1-1 1/2 hours. A pressure cooker may be used
              to shorten the time of tenderizing the beef.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the meantime, extract the color from the anatto seeds by
              immersing them in boiling water. Stir. Strain the seeds and set
              aside the red-colored liquid.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the meat is tender, add the banana flowers or banana blossoms
              and the peanut butter. Stir to ensure the peanut butter melts into
              the sauce. Add the rest of the vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the red liquid from the annatto seeds. Add just enough liquid
              to turn the sauce into a deep yellow or mustardy color. Continue
              to cook just until the vegetables are tender but not mushy. Taste
              and season lightly, if desired or needed. (Don’t make it too salty
              because it will be served with a salty condiment on the side).
            </li>
            <li>
              Quickly blanch the bok choy in boiling water to allow it to wilt.
              Transfer the stew to a serving bowl then add the blanched bok choy
              on top. Serve on the side with shrimp paste or bagoong alamang.
              Drizzle the sauce over rice! (NOTE: If the sauce is not thick
              enough to your liking simply you may thicken it with a little
              cornstarch diluted with water.)
