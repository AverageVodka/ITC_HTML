          <h1>Curacha</h1>
          <p>
            Curacha, also known as spanner crab or red frog crab, is a Zamboanga
            delicacy prized for its sweet, succulent meat. This unique
            crustacean is typically steamed or cooked in rich, creamy sauces
            like alavar, a signature Zamboangueño sauce made with coconut milk
            and spices. Often served with rice, Curacha showcases the region's
            abundant seafood and bold, flavorful cuisine.

          <h1>Beef Rendang</h1>
          <p>
            Beef Rendang in Lanao is a rich, slow-cooked curry dish deeply
            rooted in Maranao cuisine. Made with tender beef simmered in coconut
            milk, turmeric, ginger, garlic, and a medley of spices, it develops
            a deep, aromatic flavor and a slightly dry, caramelized texture. A
            festive dish often served during special occasions, Beef Rendang
            reflects the Maranao people's culinary ties to both Filipino and
            Southeast Asian traditions.

              2 tbsp of lemongrass white part only, chopped or sliced thinly

        <section class="recipe-steps">
          <ol>
            <li>
              In a skillet over medium-high heat, add the uncooked white rice
              and cook until toasted. Place the toasted rice in a blender with a
              milling blade (or a small food processor), turn on the appliance
              and pulse/blitz until rice is finely grounded. You can use a
              mortar and pestle to do this, but might take more time from you.
              Set this aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using mortar and pestle (or food processor/blender), add palapa
              (or palapa substitute), fresh turmeric, lemongrass and chili.
              Pound everything together. Set this aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a bowl, add the pieces of beef, the toasted and grounded rice
              and the spice mixture. Mix everything and let this marinate while
              we prepare the other ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a skillet over medium high heat, add coconut meat and cook
              until toasted, while stirring frequently. This might take 10-20
              minutes. Make sure to watch it closely as the coconut meat burns
              easily. When the coconut is toasted, add the this a food processor
              or a blender with the milling blade. Turn on the appliance and
              ground finely. Set this aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a pot over medium-high heat, add about 2 tbsp of oil. Add the
              marinated pieces of beef and give it a good mix. Cover the pot for
              about 20 minutes, making sure to check and stir in between. You
              may notice that burnt spices, it’s okay as long as it doesn’t
              smell bad.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, it’s time to add the coconut milk and kaffir lime leaves. You
              can use bay leaves, according to Google, if you don’t have kaffir
              lime leaves. Cover the pot again and simmer over low heat for 1 &
              1/2 hours to 2 hours or until meat is tender. Make sure to check
              and stir from time to time to prevent the meat from burning.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the meat is cooked, heat another skillet over medium-high
              heat. Add oil to the skillet and saute lemongrass, spring onions
              and chili – cook them for about 1 minute. Add the toasted coconut
              and zest of 1-2 limes. You can now add the cooked meat and cook
              for a few minutes. Don’t forget to add salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              To serve, transfer the Beef Rendang to a plate. Garnish with more
              spring onions and chili. Serve with white rice.

          <h1>Pyaggang Chicken</h1>
          <p>
            Pyanggang Chicken is a flavorful dish from Sulu, known for its
            distinctive smoky and aromatic taste. The chicken is marinated in a
            mixture of turmeric, garlic, and coconut milk, then grilled to
            perfection. It’s often served with a side of rice and a dipping
            sauce made from fermented fish or shrimp paste, highlighting the
            rich, bold flavors of Sulu’s culinary heritage.

            <li>
              Burning and extracting the coconut meat: On a hard outdoor
              surface, rest each coconut on its side and firmly tap its shell
              with a hammer, rotating it with each strike. Crack each coconut in
              half, discarding the liquid inside. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a flat bed of searing hot coals and place each coconut
              shell on top, meat-side down. Let the shells roast between 15-20
              minutes, until the meat inside is charred black. Carefully remove
              from the heat and let cool.
            </li>
            <li>
              With a spoon, scrape the coconut meat off its shell and reserve in
              a bowl. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              Making the spice paste: Place garlic, onion, ginger, turmeric,
              green onion, and lemongrass, and chili peppers, if using, in a
              food processor and grind to break down. Slowly pour in the 3
              tablespoons of vegetable oil to create a smooth paste. Drizzle in
              about one tablespoon of the blackened coconut meat powder and
              continue to blend. Season with salt, to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Combine the chicken pieces and spice paste together in a bowl or
              plastic storage bag, making sure the meat is fully coated.
              Marinate in the refrigerator for several hours, up to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
              When ready to grill, remove the chicken pieces from the container
              and place on a platter. Reserve the spice paste.
            </li>
            <li>
              Set up your grill for indirect grilling and heat to medium-high.
              Place a drip pan between the piles of coals. Position the chicken
              on the grate over the drip pan and cook with the lid down for 40
              minutes.
            </li>
            <li>While the chicken is cooking, make the basting sauce.</li>
            <li>
              Add a tablespoon of vegetable oil to a medium saucepan over
              medium-high heat and stir-fry the spice paste until fragrant. Add
              the coconut milk and bring to a low boil, continuing to stir.
              Lower the heat, then add about a half a teaspoon of the burnt
              coconut meat for color. Season with salt, to taste. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              After the forty minutes, move the chicken pieces directly over the
              coals and baste with the sauce. Turn over after ten minutes and
              repeat the process. (Total cooking time on the chicken thighs will
              be about 60 minutes. The internal temperature should be 165
              degrees.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the chicken from the heat and serve warm with steaming
              white rice and the remaining warmed basting sauce.
